# MineSweeper
MineSweeper Project for CIS164


I hope you guys read this.  Ive been trying to log into blackboard since yesterday so I cant talk on the discussion board until I can log in.  Not sure if any of you are having problems and not sure what to do about the meeting today.

I have been having the same problems with logging onto blackboard. If we need to meet using a different program I can do that or if we need to reschedule for a different day
when we have access to blackboard I make that work as well. - Caleb

Currently I can log into blackboard just fine, I'm okay with either needing to use a different program or reschedule too. - Trever 

I can log into blackboard but I don't see the blackboard link we can use to call each other, I am also okay with a reschedule or using another program -Daniel
